Tutorial overview

This tutorial will show you how to create a macro for Confluence. 
Macros are treated as plugins in Confluence and other Atlassian applications. 
The macro you'll build for Confluence generates a list of macros used on a page, 
and outputs them in a table format. 

This is a good tutorial if you've never developed an add-on before.
